	abstract = {Unwanted side effects of drugs are a burden on patients and a severe impediment in the development of new drugs. At the same time, adverse drug reactions ({ADRs}) recorded during clinical trials are an important source of human phenotypic data. It is therefore essential to combine data on drugs, targets and side effects into a more complete picture of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the ways in which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created the {SIDER} ('Side Effect Resource', http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and {ADRs}. The current release, {SIDER} 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 {ADRs} and 140 064 drug-{ADR} pairs, which is an increase of 40\% compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for 39\% of drug-{ADR} pairs, 19\% of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo treatment. {SIDER} furthermore contains a data set of drug indications, extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to {ADRs}.},

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency viruses ({HIV}) are two species of Lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that infect humans. Over time, they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ({AIDS}), a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with {HIV} is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the {HIV} subtype. In most cases, {HIV} is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids. Research has shown (for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples) that {HIV} is untransmittable through condomless sexual intercourse if the {HIV}-positive partner has a consistently undetectable viral load. Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid, and through breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, {HIV} is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.
{HIV} infects vital cells in the human immune system, such as helper T cells (specifically {CD}4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. {HIV} infection leads to low levels of {CD}4+ T cells through a number of mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected {CD}4+ T cells by {CD}8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When {CD}4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections, leading to the development of {AIDS}.},

	abstract = {Blockade of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene ({hERG}) channel by small molecules induces the prolongation of the {QT} interval which leads to fatal cardiotoxicity and accounts for the withdrawal or severe restrictions on the use of many approved drugs. In this study, we develop a deep learning approach, termed {deephERG}, for prediction of {hERG} blockers of small molecules in drug discovery and postmarketing surveillance. In total, we assemble 7,889 compounds with well-defined experimental data on the {hERG} and with diverse chemical structures. We find that {deephERG} models built by a multitask deep neural network ({DNN}) algorithm outperform those built by single-task {DNN}, naı̈ve Bayes ({NB}), support vector machine ({SVM}), random forest ({RF}), and graph convolutional neural network ({GCNN}). Specifically, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) value for the best model of {deephERG} is 0.967 on the validation set. Furthermore, based on 1,824 U.S. Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) approved drugs, 29.6\% drugs are computationally identified to have potential {hERG} inhibitory activities by {deephERG}, highlighting the importance of {hERG} risk assessment in early drug discovery. Finally, we showcase several novel predicted {hERG} blockers on approved antineoplastic agents, which are validated by clinical case reports, experimental evidence, and the literature. In summary, this study presents a powerful deep learning-based tool for risk assessment of {hERG}-mediated cardiotoxicities in drug discovery and postmarketing surveillance.},

	abstract = {We have identified a conserved family of genes related to Drosophila eag, which encodes a distinct type of voltage-activated K+ channel. Three related genes were recovered in screens of {cDNA} libraries from Drosophila, mouse, and human tissues. One gene is the mouse counterpart of eag; the other two represent additional subfamilies. The human gene maps to chromosome 7. Family members share at least 47\% amino acid identity in their hydrophobic cores and all contain a segment homologous to a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. Sequence comparisons indicate that members of this family are most closely related to vertebrate cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels and plant inward-rectifying K+ channels. The existence of another family of K+ channel structural genes further extends the known diversity of K+ channels and has important implications for the structure, function, and evolution of the superfamily of voltage-sensitive ion channels.},

	abstract = {The binding affinities ({IC}50) reported for diverse structural and chemical classes of human β-secretase 1 ({BACE}-1) inhibitors in literature were modeled using multiple in silico ligand based modeling approaches and statistical techniques. The descriptor space encompasses simple binary molecular fingerprint, one- and two-dimensional constitutional, physicochemical, and topological descriptors, and sophisticated three-dimensional molecular fields that require appropriate structural alignments of varied chemical scaffolds in one universal chemical space. The affinities were modeled using qualitative classification or quantitative regression schemes involving linear, nonlinear, and deep neural network ({DNN}) machine-learning methods used in the scientific literature for quantitative–structure activity relationships ({QSAR}). In a departure from tradition, ∼20\% of the chemically diverse data set (205 compounds) was used to train the model with the remaining ∼80\% of the structural and chemical analogs used as part of an external validation (1273 compounds) and prospective test (69 compounds) sets respectively to ascertain the model performance. The machine-learning methods investigated herein performed well in both the qualitative classification (∼70\% accuracy) and quantitative {IC}50 predictions ({RMSE} ∼ 1 log). The success of the 2D descriptor based machine learning approach when compared against the 3D field based technique pursued for {hBACE}-1 inhibitors provides a strong impetus for systematically applying such methods during the lead identification and optimization efforts for other protein families as well.},

	shorttitle = {{MoleculeNet}},
	abstract = {Molecular machine learning has been maturing rapidly over the last few years. Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces {MoleculeNet}, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. {MoleculeNet} curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the {DeepChem} open source library). {MoleculeNet} benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.},
